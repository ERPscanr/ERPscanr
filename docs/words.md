# Data-Driven Profiles

For each ERP component, we create a data-driven profile that summarizes the collected articles.

Each profile includes some summary data such as the the number of published papers, the most common keywords, and the most common authors and journals publishing papers on this component. It also includes
figures showing the number of articles across publication year, and a wordcloud made from the distribution of words in all collected abstracts.

## List of ERPs:
