# ERP Network

In this analysis, a network approach is used to investigate how different ERP components relate to each other.

To do so, each node in the network is an ERP, sub-selected to include only ERP components for which at least 150 articles were found. Each weighted edge (connection) in the network is a measure of often these ERP terms are mentioned in the same articles.

This allows for a quantification and visualization of patterns in the literature:

In the network representation above, we can see that the network of ERP components is quite dense, as many components connect to many other components. There are some notably strong connections, indicating components that are commonly discussed together, such as the ERN & Pe, and the N400 and P600.
